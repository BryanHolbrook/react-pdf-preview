# React PDF Uploader & Viewer 

Description:

Upload and display PDFs easily in your React app. 

PDF Uploader & Viewer is built with Accessibility in mind. Currently rendering PDFs as transparent text layers that can be read by screen readers, that help the visually impaired to access your uploaded content. Itâ€™s awesome!

It can also be customized to allow PDFs to be rendered as images thanks to the React-pdf package if necessary.
